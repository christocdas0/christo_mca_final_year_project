- VS Code (recommended for editing and running the project)

### Steps to Run UI
1. **Extract the ZIP file**  
   Locate and extract `christo_mca_final_year_project-main.zip`.

2. **Open VS Code**

   - Option 2: Navigate to the project folder and right-click > "Open with VS Code".

3. **Navigate to the `front-end` Folder**
   - Open the `front-end` folder in VS Code.

4. **Install Dependencies**
   - Open the terminal in VS Code (make sure itâ€™s in the `front-end` directory).
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     npm install --force
     ```
   - This command installs all the required packages listed in `package.json`. The process may take a few minutes depending on your internet speed.

   > ðŸ“˜ For installation guidance, refer to _"Set-up and Run Using Download as .zip"_ (Pages 84â€“88) in the project documentation.

5. **Start the Front-End Server**
   - Once the installation is complete, run:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - The application will be available at `http://localhost:3001`.

6. **Access the Application**
   - Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3001` to view the front-end of the application.

2. **Open VS Code**
   - Use the same method as in the UI setup to open the project folder.

3. **Navigate to the `back-end` Folder**
   - Open the `back-end` folder in VS Code.

4. **Install Dependencies**
   - Open the terminal in VS Code (make sure itâ€™s in the `back-end` directory).

     ```bash
     npm install --force
     ```
   - This installs all required packages from the `package.json` file.

   > ðŸ“˜ For installation guidance, refer to _"Set-up and Run Using Download as .zip"_ (Pages 84â€“88) in the project documentation.

5. **Start the Back-End Server**

     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
